# ADL-HW2

## Environment
Environment setup procedure is almost the same as `adl-hw1`.
Note that **my CUDA version is 11.6**, due to me having difficulty making my GPU run CUDA 10.2.

## Training Procedure
Refer to `training.sh` for training pipeline, and the python files for exact requirements for arguments.

For directory specifications, please directly modify `training.sh`. All directory names are at the head of script.

+ Preprocess the train / valid files into SQuAD and SWAG format by `preprocess_dataset.py`.
+ Train the model by `run_swag_no_trainer.py` and `run_qa_no_trainer.py`.

## Testing Procedure
Refer to `run.sh` for testing pipeline.

+ Preprocess the test files into SWAG format by `preprocess_dataset.py`.
+ Use `run_swag_no_trainer.py` to do testing, and `process_cs_output.py` for postprocessing.
+ Use `run_qa_no_trainer.py` to do testing, and `process_qa_output.py` for postprocessing.

Note that **the script also requires SWAG and SQuAD files for train & test**, since what I did is to skip the training process, but the script still requires some information from train files (e.g. json format, etc.)
I will download it along with the model, but the actual content (meaning the actual question and answer itself) will not be used.

## Graph
Use `graph.py` to graph, given model's `all_results.json` file generated by `run_qa_no_trainer.py` after training.
